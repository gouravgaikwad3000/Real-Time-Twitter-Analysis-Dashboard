# Twitter Engagement Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Twitter engagement data to derive meaningful insights that can inform and optimize social media strategies. By examining key engagement metrics such as likes, retweets, replies, media views, and clicks, the project aims to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations within the data.

## Project Structure

- **Data Filtering:** Accurately filtered tweets based on specific criteria such as date ranges, media engagement levels, and posting times. Advanced filtering features in Power BI were used to ensure precise data segmentation.
  
- **Data Analysis:** Performed detailed analysis on engagement metrics to understand the impact of media content, app opens, and click types on overall tweet performance.

- **Visualization:** Created a variety of visualizations using Power BI, including line charts, bar charts, dual-axis charts, and pie charts, to effectively communicate insights.

- **Challenges and Solutions:**
  - **Data Filtering:** Utilized Power BI’s advanced filtering and validation techniques to ensure accurate tweet segmentation.
  - **Visualization Complexity:** Iteratively designed and refined visualizations to ensure clarity and effectiveness.
  - **Data Volume:** Implemented data reduction techniques and optimized data models in Power BI for efficient data processing.

## Key Deliverables

- **Visualizations:**
  - Line chart showing the trend of average engagement rates over each month, comparing tweets with and without media.
  - Comparative charts for replies, retweets, and likes on high-engagement tweets posted in the last six months.
  - Dual-axis chart showing media views and engagements by the day of the week, highlighting significant spikes.
  - Pie chart representing the proportion of clicks for tweets with more than 500 impressions, including drill-down features.

- **Reports:**
  - A comprehensive report detailing the findings, including Introduction, Background, Learning Objectives, Activities and Tasks, Skills and Competencies, Feedback and Evidence, Challenges and Solutions, Outcomes and Impact, and Conclusion.
